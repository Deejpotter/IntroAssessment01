# (d) Write an interactive program. Prompt the user with a question, e.g., “What is your favorite number from 0 to 9?”
# Save the user selection into a variable, e.g., b=input (“What is your Favorite number from 0 to 9?”)

# Get the user's favourite number
num = input("What is your favourite number from 0 to 9? ")

# Print the number
print("Your favourite number is " + num)

# I referenced the Module 2 Resources for this code.
