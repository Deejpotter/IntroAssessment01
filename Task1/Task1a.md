# Task 1a

- (a) Identify the industry-standard integrated development environment (IDE) for Python. As a beginner, which IDE would
  you opt to use? Justify your answer

Answer:

The industry-standard IDE for Python is PyCharm. As a beginner, I would probably use PyCharm because it's a powerful IDE with a lot of features.
Even though it's probably more complicated to use, it's also an industry-standard, so it would be useful for me to learn how to use it for the future.
